# TicTacToe

Tic Tac Toe, also known as "noughts and crosses," is a simple logic game for two players. The players take turns placing their symbols – one player chooses **X** and the other **O** – on a 3x3 grid. The goal of the game is to align three of your symbols in a row: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

**Rules:**
1. Players take turns placing their symbols in empty spaces.
2. The player who first aligns three of their symbols in a row wins.
3. If the entire grid is filled and no one has aligned three symbols, the game ends in a tie.

Though it's a simple game, Tic Tac Toe still requires strategic thinking.
